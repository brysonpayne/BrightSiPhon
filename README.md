# BrightSiPhon
BrightSiPhon is a proof-of-concept for exfiltrating data from a system using screen brightness modulation to transmit binary data.

The PowerShell Script (BrightSiPhon.ps1) version of this approach works on Windows laptops, Surface tablets, all-in-one PCs, and other Windows devices with programmable screen brightness via WMI. This code will be released during Hacker Halted 2021 (October 7-8, 2021).
